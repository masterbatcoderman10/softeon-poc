Here is a brief description of each screen involved in the process:\n\n1. **User Management Screen**:\n   - **Path**: `Administrator > Security > Security Profile > User (tab)`\n   - **Description**: This screen is used to create new user accounts and manage existing ones. Administrators can enter mandatory information such as the user's first name, last name, user ID, and password. Optional information like email address, portal/dashboard access, and additional authentication methods can also be specified. The screen allows setting user roles, such as admin or RF user, and configuring other user-specific settings.\n\n2. **Advanced User Map Screen**:\n   - **Path**: `Administrator > Security > Security Profile > Advanced User Map (tab)`\n   - **Description**: This screen is used to map users to specific user groups. Administrators can select a user group and then map one or more users to that group. This helps in managing permissions and access controls based on group policies.\n\n3. **User Group Management Screen**:\n   - **Path**: `Administrator > Security > Security Profile > User Group (tab)`\n   - **Description**: This screen is used to create and manage user groups. Administrators can define user groups and assign specific permissions and roles to each group. This allows for efficient management of user access and security settings based on group membership.\n\n4. **Role Management Screen**:\n   - **Path**: `Administrator > Security > Security Profile > Role (tab)`\n   - **Description**: This screen is used to define and manage roles within the WMS. Roles determine the level of access and permissions a user or user group has within the system. Administrators can create new roles, assign specific permissions to each role, and then map these roles to users or user groups.\n\n5. **Permission Management Screen**:\n   - **Path**: `Administrator > Security > Security Profile > Permission (tab)`\n   - **Description**: This screen is used to manage the specific permissions associated with different roles and user groups. Administrators can define what actions and access levels are allowed for each role, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions to perform their tasks.\n\nBy utilizing these screens, administrators can efficiently create and manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and ensure that security policies are consistently applied across the Softeon WMS.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2723, "total_tokens": 3235}, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13", "system_fingerprint": "fp_157b3831f5", "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": "run-84e01200-b0e6-4aae-8c47-cb51ecce6c4a-0", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 2723, "output_tokens": 512, "total_tokens": 3235}}}]
