The image is a repetitive geometric pattern consisting of alternating black and white shapes. Each unit of the pattern is composed of four main elements:

1. A white circle positioned above the center.
2. A white square beneath the circle.
3. An arc within the square, cutting across diagonally.
4. A white shape resembling a chevron or a stylized "L" next to the square, creating a sense of movement or flow.

The overall pattern forms a grid, with each unit aligned in rows and columns. The repetition of the shapes creates a visually striking and cohesive design. The use of black and white provides a high contrast, enhancing the clarity and impact of the geometric elements.
