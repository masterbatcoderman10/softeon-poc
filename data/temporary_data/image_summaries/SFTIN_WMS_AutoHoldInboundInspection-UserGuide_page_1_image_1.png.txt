The image consists of a repeating geometric pattern. The pattern features a combination of circles and angular shapes that create a visually interesting, rhythmic design. 

Each unit in the pattern appears to have:
1. A white circle.
2. A white angular shape that resembles an abstract human figure with a curved line on one side.
3. The shapes are arranged on a black background.

The pattern is uniform, with the shapes positioned in a grid-like formation, resulting in a consistent and repetitive visual effect across the entire image. The black and white contrast enhances the clarity and distinction of the shapes, making the pattern stand out.
