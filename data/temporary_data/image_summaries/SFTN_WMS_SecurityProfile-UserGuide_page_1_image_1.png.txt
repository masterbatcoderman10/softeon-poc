The provided image features a repetitive geometric pattern in black and white. The pattern consists of a grid of identical abstract figures arranged in rows and columns. Each figure comprises three main elements:

1. A white circle situated at the top left or top right corner of the black background.
2. A white square with a portion cut out, forming a right angle, positioned below the circle.
3. A white curved line that extends from the top edge of the square to the right edge, creating a quarter-circle shape.

The figures are evenly spaced, forming a seamless and continuous pattern that covers the entire image. The repetition of shapes and the high contrast between black and white create a visually engaging and dynamic design.
