The image consists of a repeated geometric pattern in black and white. Each unit of the pattern features a combination of shapes that include a circle, two rectangles, and a curved line.

- The circle is placed at the top left corner of each unit.
- The two rectangles are arranged in an "L" shape, with the vertical rectangle positioned to the left and the horizontal rectangle placed below it.
- The curved line is situated in the bottom right section of the unit and connects the top of the horizontal rectangle to the bottom of the vertical rectangle, forming a quarter-circle arc.

The pattern units are aligned in a grid format, with each row and column containing multiple repetitions of the unit. The overall design creates a visually striking and rhythmic arrangement.
