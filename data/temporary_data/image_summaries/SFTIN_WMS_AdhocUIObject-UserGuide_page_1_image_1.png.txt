The provided image is a repeating geometric pattern composed of white shapes on a black background. The pattern consists of two main elements:

1. A stylized figure that looks like an abstract representation of a person. This figure is composed of a circle (representing the head) above a combination of shapes that form the body and arms. The body consists of a quarter-circle and an L-shaped block. The quarter-circle is positioned on the upper left of the L-shaped block.

2. These figures are arranged in a grid, alternating between two orientations. The orientation alternates between a figure facing left and a figure facing right. Each row shifts the figures slightly to create a staggered effect.

The overall design creates a visually engaging and rhythmic pattern due to the consistent repetition and contrasting colors.
