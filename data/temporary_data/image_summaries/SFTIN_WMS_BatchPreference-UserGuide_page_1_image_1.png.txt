The image depicts a repetitive geometric pattern composed of white shapes on a black background. The pattern consists of two primary elements arranged in a grid:

1. A white circle positioned at the center top of each tile.
2. A combination of two white shapes forming an abstract figure, resembling a stylized human figure or letter "R." One part of this figure is a quarter circle, and the other is a bent rectangular shape with a curved edge.

Each "tile" in the grid contains these elements, creating a uniform and symmetrical pattern. The design alternates between rows and columns, maintaining consistency across the entire image. The use of black and white emphasizes the contrast and clarity of the geometric shapes.
