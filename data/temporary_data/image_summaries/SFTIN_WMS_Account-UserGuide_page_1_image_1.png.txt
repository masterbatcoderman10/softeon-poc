The provided image is a repeated pattern consisting of geometric shapes in a black and white color scheme. Each individual unit of the pattern includes the following features:

1. A white circle positioned in the top left corner.
2. A white square with a quarter-circle cut out from the bottom right corner, placed directly below the circle.
3. An adjacent white shape that resembles a combination of a right angle and a quarter-circle arc, creating an overall appearance similar to an abstract human figure.

The pattern repeats this unit in a grid-like formation, with each row and column aligned to form a consistent and orderly design. The background of the image is black, which contrasts with the white shapes, making the pattern stand out distinctly.
