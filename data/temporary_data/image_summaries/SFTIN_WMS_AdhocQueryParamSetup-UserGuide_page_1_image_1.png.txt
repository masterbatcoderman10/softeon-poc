The image is a repeating pattern composed of geometric shapes in a black-and-white color scheme. Each unit of the pattern contains a combination of shapes that include a large white square, a smaller white square, a white circle, and a curved line within the smaller square. The shapes are arranged in such a way that the pattern alternates horizontally and vertically, creating a visually interesting and consistent design. The white shapes stand out prominently against the black background, giving the pattern a stark, modern, and abstract appearance. The repetition of elements forms a cohesive and balanced look throughout the entire image.
