The image is a screenshot of a security profile interface from a software application named Softeon. The interface is under the "Advanced User Map" tab, part of several other tabs including "User," "Group," "Module Map," "User Access Map," and "Menu Access."

The interface is divided into two primary sections:

1. **User Group Selection (Left Side):**

     - S7UG2 (ATM User Group)
     - S7UG3 (ATM User Group)
     - UIGRP (UI Group)
   - The "ADM" (Admin user group) is currently selected, indicated by the highlighted row and checked radio button.

2. **User Selection (Right Side):**
   - Displays a list of users with their User ID and Name.
   - Users are categorized as either "Mapped Users" or "Unmapped Users":
     - Mapped Users (highlighted with green checkmarks):
       - CMURUGES (CHANDRAMOHAN MURUGESAN)
       - JARROYO (j arroyo)

       - DEMOUSER (demo user)
   - The list can be scrolled for additional users.

At the bottom of the interface, there are three action buttons: "Submit," "Reset," and "Refresh."
