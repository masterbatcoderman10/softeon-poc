   - The interface has multiple tabs: User, Group, Advanced User Map, Module Map (currently active), User Access Map, Menu Access.

2. **Selection Options:**
   - Two radio buttons are present for selection: "User Group" (selected) and "User ID."

3. **Warehouse and Module Selection:**
   - Warehouse: A dropdown menu is shown with "WH1" selected.
   - Module: Another dropdown menu is shown with "ADM-Admin Management" selected.

4. **User Group Selection Table:**
   - The table is titled "User Group Selection."
   - The table has three columns: a checkbox column for selection, "User Group," and "Name."
   - The user groups are:
     - ADM (Admin user group)
     - DMUG (demouser)
     - EXTGROUP (EXTGROUP)
     - MIS (MIS user group)
     - S7UG1 (ATM User Group)

   - At the bottom of the interface, there are three buttons: Submit, Reset, Refresh.

6. **Header and Branding:**
   - The top right corner displays the Softeon logo.
   - A search menu bar is present at the top, along with icons for various functionalities (search, notifications, help, user profile).

The interface appears to be used for mapping user groups to a specific module within a warehouse context.
