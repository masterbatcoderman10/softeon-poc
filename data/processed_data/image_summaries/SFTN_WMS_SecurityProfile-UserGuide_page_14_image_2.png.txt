The image is a screenshot of a Security Profile configuration interface from a software application named Softeon. The interface is focused on mapping modules to user groups or user IDs.

### Overview:
- **Tabs:**
  - The interface has several tabs at the top: User, Group, Advanced User Map, Module Map, User Access Map, and Menu Access. The current tab selected is "Module Map."

### Configuration Options:
- **Selection Type:**
  - There are two radio buttons at the top to select either "User Group" or "User ID". The "User ID" option is currently selected.

- **Warehouse:**
  - A dropdown menu labeled "Warehouse" is available, and it currently displays "WH1."

- **Module:**
  - A dropdown menu labeled "Module" is available, and it currently displays "ADM-Admin Management."

### User Group Selection:
- **User Group Table:**
  - A table labeled "User Group Selection" lists several user groups with two columns: "User Group" and "Name."
    - The user groups listed are:
      - ADM: Admin user group
      - DMUG: demouser
      - EXTGROUP: EXTGROUP
      - MIS: MIS user group
      - S7UG1: ATM User Group
      - UIGRP: UI Group

### User Selection:
- **User Selection Table:**
  - There is an empty table labeled "User Selection" with two columns: "User ID" and "Name." Since "User ID" is selected, it expects specific user IDs to be listed here.

### Action Buttons:
- **Buttons at the Bottom:**
  - There are three action buttons at the bottom of the interface:
    - Submit (green)
    - Reset (blue)
    - Refresh (blue)

### Additional Features:
- **Search and Icons:**
  - At the top right, thereâ€™s a search bar labeled "Search menu..." along with a set of icons representing search, undo, help, notifications, and user account options.

### Branding:
- **Logo:**
  - The Softeon logo is visible at the top right corner of the interface.

This interface seems to be used for assigning access and permissions to specific user groups or user IDs within different modules and warehouses in the Softeon system.
