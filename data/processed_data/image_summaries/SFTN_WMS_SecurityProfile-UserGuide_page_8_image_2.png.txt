   - "Last Name" field, also marked with a red asterisk indicating it is required.
   - "Password" field, another required field indicated by a red asterisk.
   - "Confirm Password" field, marked with a red asterisk indicating it is required.
   - An additional "User ID" field in the "User Group" section, highlighted in green and marked as required.

5. **Action Buttons:**
   - "Submit" button highlighted in green.
   - "Reset" button in blue.

   - "Back" button in blue.

6. **Table Section:**
